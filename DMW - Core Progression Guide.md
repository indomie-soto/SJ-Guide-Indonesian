Are you a new player that absolutely hates the idea of having to farm for money just to actually do content? Do you want to play the game to get stronger, even though it might take longer and be less optimal than other ways of playing? Well, this guide is for you! *Brought to you by the same guy who did [this guide](https://discord.com/channels/1371914476424527963/1403899517320822936/1403899517320822936)* 

Important Notes Before Reading:
- DMW as a whole is **NOT** a Solo venture. Yes, sometimes our community sucks and gatekeeping runs rampant, however you will not be able to progress to endgame completely solo unless you choose to buy your way there. Find a party to do dungeons with.
- This is NOT the most optimal and quick way to becoming able to do content. If that's what you want, ask around for advice instead of reading this. This guide is for those who want to put in the effort to actually understand the game and how to play, not spend the first 30+ hours farming Tera to buy X digimon or Y digimon. At times, your progression *will* stall. That's part of taking this path, but it will eventually clear up and you'll either enjoy this game or hate it.
- You will not be pumping out insane damage numbers at first. You're a new player, it's OK to be weak. Find parties with other new players (or let an experienced player carry you, if they are willing) so you all can enjoy the journey. Skipping crucial parts of early game via money farming is easy, but it can also burn you out very quickly and turn a potentially fun experience into a chore.
	- That all said, this game *does* demand a good bit of grinding. If you aren't willing to grind, this isn't the game for you.
- This guide does not *and will not* account for Events. I can't see the future, things change and certain routes become more viable at some points over others.
- Lastly, sorry aspiring Tanks. This guide does not and cannot account for you. Early game is designed around OG DMO philosophy, which does not include tanks as they are a *DMW-exclusive* role. Unfortunately, that means you'll be doing some money farming or will need to run as a DPS first then swap later on. Hopefully an experienced tank will make a guide for you all.

# Picking Your Class

You've just loaded up DMW, or Digital Masters World, having created an account with good ol' @Donny however, you encounter a problem: You don't know what you're doing! For some of you, this is an entirely new branch of DMO that seems entirely unfamiliar. For others, its your first digimon MMO experience and you're utterly lost.

As partially mentioned above, DMW introduces a rudimentary **Class System**. All Digimon ranked SS+ or above are given one of 4 classes: Skill DPS (SK), Auto Attack DPS (AA), Tank (TA) and Support (SUP). 
- Skill DPS mainly use Skills to dish out damage
- Auto Attack DPS use mainly auto attacks to dish out damage
- Tanks have high HP pools and high Defense to take the heavy hits mid to endgame bosses dish out. Conversely, they dish out much less damage compared to DPS classes.
	- Added bonus, they do *not* gain Basic Attribute from gear. Instead, for every 1K Defense, they gain 1%. Similarly, for every 10k HP, they gain 1%.
- Support Digimon fall into one of the two DPS classes. However, they have an effect on their F3 that gives a damage boost to the DPS class they fall into. Conversely, they deal less damage overall compared to an equally ranked DPS.
	- As an exception, UlforceVeedramon Future Mode has a defensive F3 and F4. He also can be used as a SK DPS or an AA DPS, depending on the user's gear.

Now that you (hopefully) understand the different classes, we can go over the pros and cons of the two DPS classes:
- SK DPS
	- Pros: High Burst Damage, Less "Focus" Stats on gear (HP, Basic Attribute, Skill Flat/Skill %), Seals are not as necessary to reach full power, High potential for "skipping" boss mechanics
	- Cons: Skill Position Lock (Aka a badly timed skill can cause you to get hit by a boss mechanic), poorly timed skills can result in huge DPS loss, Deck progression is arguably harder
- AA DPS
	- Pros: Consistent Damage across the board, Access to the 'Guardian' Memory Skill (aka free damage reduction of up to 20%), Overall easier Deck Progression, Very little position lock so easy maneuverability for boss mechanics
	- Cons: Cannot skip without high damage, More "Focus" stats on gear (Basic Attribute, Critical Damage, Hit Rate, Attack, Critical [If severely lacking]) means a sacrifice on HP otherwise lowering total damage, high damage parties will sometimes refuse for early-midgame content (Can be circumvented by forming your own party)

And with that comes the final question: You want to play as X class, so what tamer and partner digimon should you pick?

If you decide to play as a SK DPS, unfortunately your early game tamer doesn't matter. However, I recommend Yoshino due to her tamer skill (Protection) being a 'Get-Out-Of-Big-Damage-Free' Card and may prove useful. As a starter, you should choose Falcomon. 

If you decide to run as an AA DPS, you should run Keenan Crier as your first Tamer. His Tamer Skill, "Shock", gives a Critical Damage increase that'll prove strong as an early game AA. For your digimon partner, you'll want to pick Agumon.

If you're curious about the reasoning, you do not need a Data SSS for a lot of the early game content or even a majority of our currently released late game content. However, a Vaccine SSS is indispensable for early game.

Once you've selected your tamer and partner, you're officially ready to start your journey.
# Pre-Early Game

You'll be introduced to the game with an introductory fight as Omegamon X against Dexmon, showcasing the game's basic combat. Following this, the game's initial tutorial will start, giving you a very rudimentary explanation of the game and how it functions.  Follow the quests until you are teleported to Jijimon in DMW Village. 
- Hold onto the Journey Exchange Ticket and Starter Package Ticket items you've obtained. You'll use them after the tutorial.

Do not worry about the "A new world" quest. As a new player, you are not able to complete the entire questline yet. Feel free to come back for it later on as it does unlock UlforceVeedramon Future Mode, the defensive support digimon mentioned above.

Once you complete the "Welcome to the Digital World" quest, accept the City of Beginnings questline and follow along to complete the tutorial until Teacher Mori gives you the "A new journey" quest and you are teleported back to DMW Village in front of Elecmon. Several things to keep in mind while doing the tutorial:
- Besides the Inventory Expansion, Warehouse Expansion and DigimonArchive Expansion items, it is much better for you to hold onto these items rather than immediately use them, especially things like the 1Day Jogress chip as it is not useful without a Digivice to equip it on.
	- As an exception to the above, the 1Day DigiAura, 1Day Sneakers, and 1Day DATS Uniform costume *should be used and equipped*. Base running speed in the game is not good, unfortunately. Utilize these to get around much faster than you would normally, as you will get decent replacements soon enough. The DigiAura will also make the tutorial much simpler as you will not need to worry about the DS costs of your starter digimon's evolutions.

Now that you've finished the City of Beginnings questline and are back in DMW Village, you should find yourself in front of Elecmon. Before you accept the next quest he has for you, "A new journey II", you have a few things to do here in DMW Village first:
- Start the Novice Questline by accepting the quests from the Tsunomon and Koromon NPCs
- Trade your Starter Exchange Ticket for the starter package corresponding to your Starter
	- This package **does not** have a Starter Egg inside. If you choose the wrong package, you will have a harder time following the guide.
- Trade in your Journey Exchange Ticket for your future Virus SSS:
	- If you chose to be a SK DPS, you'll want to trade for the Dukemon Shin Package
	- If you chose to be an AA DPS, you'll want to trade for the LordKnightmon X Package.
- Open the 3 Packages you have obtained: Your Starter Package, the Journey Exchange Package and the Lala's Gift Package. **I highly recommend that you do not start opening the packages within the packages without reading ahead first.**

Inside your Starter Package should be:
- The SS+ Evolution Item
- The SSS Evolution Item
- 15 Mega Reinforced DigiClone Set Boxes [Savers] (Wait, what are DigiClones?)
	- If you have never played DMO, [this page](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/DigiClone) will explain the process much better than I can. But in short, it's a way to permanently increase your digimon's stats and is required for them to hit their full potential. There are 4 types of digiclones:
		- Normal - They have a chance to fail and aren't guaranteed to enhance by the maximum stat
		- Reinforced - They have a chance to fail, but if they succeed, guarantee max stat.
		- Mega - They cannot fail but do not guarantee max stat increase
		- Mega Reinforced - They cannot fail and guarantee max stat increase
	- That [Savers] suffix means they can only be used on Starter Digimon (Agumon (S), Lalamon, Falcomon and Gaomon). They do not work on any other digimon, including your Journey Package digimon. Unfortunately for your future second starter, you will not be able to use any other DigiClones on a Starter. In simpler terms, [Savers] DigiClones for Starter Digimon, Non-Savers DigiClones for every other Digimon. 
- 2 Level 5 Raremon Digi-Eggs
	- I highly recommend waiting to attempt to hatch these as you probably don't have any Devil hatch data.
- 2 Mid Class Transcendence Chips for your particular Starter (Wait a minute, what's Transcendence?)
	- If you didn't take the time to read the Transcendence page linked in the DigiClone page, you should take the time to [read it now](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Transcendence_System) as it does a much better explanation than I can. You shouldn't worry about this for now, as you likely don't have enough money for this.
- 500 Fruit of Homeostasis[Savers]
	- As mentioned in the Transcendence Wiki Page, you need these fruits to re-size your Transcended Digimon. Unfortunately, Starter Digimon do require special [Savers] fruits as well.
- 1 Growth Fruit[Savers]
	- Thankfully, another wiki page that can explain better than I can [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Digimon_Sizes). While Starter Digimon normally cannot be re-sized, this growth fruit automatically promotes them to 125%, giving them access to the Transcendence mechanic mentioned earlier.
- 11 Jumping Crystal [Digimon]
	- When used, these items give large amounts of EXP to the currently equipped digimon.

Inside your Journey Package should be:
- A Lv.5 Digiegg required for the Digimon you chose
- The Evolution Unlock items required for the SSS
- 50 Evoluters (The heck are Evoluters??)
	- Most Digimon, when hatched, only have their Champion-level evolutions. Sometimes, they can have higher, depending on the suffix of the egg. Some Digimon have no evolutions unlocked at first. 
	- For the majority of Digimon, Evoluters are used to unlock most of their evolutions. Some evolutions, especially those at higher ranks, are locked behind unique items.
- A Gift Package corresponding to the Digimon's class
	- This package contains a lot of items that'll help you get through the slog of early game, such as 7 day Tamer Skills, Transcendence Fruits, a Mercenary Slot Expansion, a Tamer Exchange item for one of your class's useful Tamers and more. However, a majority of these items are effectively *useless* to you until you are able to run dungeons, as that is where you will be able to make the most use out of them.
- 10 Jumping Crystal [Tamer]
	- Similar to the Digimon Jumping Crystals, they give EXP to your tamer.
- 12 Jumping Crystal [Digimon]
- 50 Low Class Data for the Digiegg
- An Underworld Accessory Box corresponding to the Digimon's class
	- This Box contains a full set of powerful accessories that last for **30 days**. Unlike normal accessories, they have a set Digitary Power and set Options (More on these concepts later!). These will be more than enough until you reach the Radiant Holy Beast set of Accessories (More on this later!). Until you are ready to run dungeons and do real content, you should *avoid* opening this box. 

Lastly, in the Lala's Gift Box:
- 50 Evoluters
- 10 Digimon Enhancement Buff Package [NEW] (Wait, we have buffs??)
	- As a standard expectation of DMW dungeon running, we have 8 1 hour buffs obtained from this package (and other sources) as well as 4 2 hour buffs obtained from dungeons.
	- As a general rule of thumb, *you should mainly use your buffs when running dungeons.* Most other parts of the game do not typically require buffs.
- Novice Accessory Box
	- Unlike the Underworld Accessories, these Novice Accessories are *much weaker* however, they are permanent. Until you're ready to progress into running dungeons, feel free to open the box and use them.
		- Also, if you have used the Saber-Toothed Accessories given earlier during the tutorial, throw them away. They cannot be upgraded and are the worst set in the game, by far.
- 5 Expansion Packages
- 15 Amplification Booster +1000%
	- These items increase the EXP gained from killing enemies for 31 minutes. They **do not** affect quest reward EXP.

Instead of continuing the questline, first you should head to DATS Center. You can't go out into the game without a strong partner to accompany you. Facing Elecmon, head to the right and talk to the Phonebooths to teleport to DATS. 
- Head to the near the back inside the building to talk to \<DATS leader> Richard Sampson. "Go inside Dats Center" and empower your starter by opening all the Mega Reinforced DigiClone Sets and Cloning all of their available stats. Thankfully, these clones do not cost any money to use.
	- You should have 3 of each Clone left. Hold onto these and once you have transcended your starter, use them on the HP stat to fully empower them.
- Utilize the Growth Fruit if you haven't already.
- Use as many Jumping Crystals [Digimon] as needed to promote your starter to Level 70, then utilize the SSS unlock item for a big and easy stat boost.
- Utilize the Jumping Crystals [Tamer] to push your Tamer to Level 70+
- Head to the DigiEgg Incubator and hatch the Lv.5 DigiEgg. Spend the Evoluters and Evolution items to unlock the SSS you chose.
- Spend the remaining Jumping Crystals on your new Digimon which should push them to Level 70+
	- If you chose LordKnightmon X, *do not* use the 30D XAI just yet. As tempting as it may be, you will want to save access to the XAI for when you can make optimal use of it. Later on, you will be able to get a worse, but permanent, version of the XAI.
- Utilize the Clones from the Gift Package to get your new Digimon's stats up. Thankfully, these clones also do not cost money.
	- Like with your starter, you should have 3 of each Clone left. Once you have transcended your journey digimon, use them on the HP stat to fully empower them.
- Unlock the DMW Digivice you were given and equip it.
	- For the time being, it's not at full power yet. Later on, we will get into Accessory Enhancement proper and get it to full power.
- If you haven't already, open up the Dungeon Ticket Box received from the tutorial. For each of these tickets, right-click to "use" them. This will move them to the Ticket Inventory. Access it by clicking the third button from the left in the bottom right corner (If you hover over it, it should say "DMW").
	- The vast majority of Dungeon Tickets can go into this inventory. Also, there is a function to claim all unlocked ticket quests across the entire game, without having to individually claim the quests from each NPC. Simply open the Ticket Inventory and click the "Claim Daily Tickets" button.
- Scan the Random BM Package and hatch the DigiEgg you were given.
	- If you're lucky, the BM package you receive will help you achieve one of the various decks for your class. If you aren't aware of what decks are, keep reading on to find out.
	- Do not worry about leveling this digimon at the moment. Focus on your starter digimon and your journey digimon.

Now that you've completed the above, feel free to return to DMW Village via the phonebooths. However, before you move on, there is one more thing to mention: [**Attribute Advantage**](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Digimon_Attributes) and [**Elemental Advantage**](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Elemental_Attributes)
- Similar to Pokemon, DIgimon has an Advantage-Disadvantage chart.
	- Vaccines (VA) cure a Virus (Vi) ; VA beats Vi
	- Viruses (Vi) infect and corrupt Data (DA); Vi beats DA
	- Data (DA) is unaffected by a Vaccine (VA); DA beats VA
	- Outside of the Attribute trifecta is Unknown (Un) and No Attribute (No). Unknown beats everything while No Attribute is weak to everything
- Having Attribute Advantage increases your damage by 50%, enemy auto attacks deal 20% less damage, and you gain damage from the 'Basic Attribute' stat on gear. Without Advantage, your damage is in neutral and you do not gain the damage boost from the "Basic Attribute" stat.
- Elemental Advantage, while a slight damage increase, isn't so significant that it should be focused on.
- You can also increase the experience of both the Attribute and Element (The empty bar underneath the Attribute and Element in the Digimon stat window) for that particular evolution of your digimon via a task based on the Attribute:
	- No: It cannot be raised.
	- Un: Kill any digimon. The Attribute EXP is automatically 100%, but the Element EXP still has to be raised.
	- VA: Kill any Virus Digimon.
	- Vi: Kill any Data Digimon.
	- DA: Use the Return DigiEgg feature. Attribute/Element EXP is based on the item being returned. Keep in mind, only the Atrribute or the Element can level up at a time, even with excess EXP. 
	- For quick DA leveling, go to Director Hashima NPC in DMW Village and buy 1250 DigiEggs and return them for a full bar of the Attribute *or* Element EXP. For the other attributes, kill the Digimon in DMW Village as they provide very high amounts of Attribute/Element EXP. You will know you've maxed them out when the icons have a green circle around them.
- Make sure to fill out your Journey digimon and Starter digimon's attributes and elements, so you will not miss out on any damage during your questing.

Now that you've done all that, you're finally prepared to continue into the next phase: Questing. Go ahead and complete Elecmon's quest. This will transport you to the Village of the Beginning, the first map of the File Island Area. As you should be tamer level 70, you should also have a few quests from your Digivice. You can access those quests by clicking the Exclamation Mark on the bottom right of the screen. Accept the "Miki's Summons" quest and "Commander's Urgent Summon" quest. These are the quests that'll lead you into the other two areas you should focus on: The Snowstorm Village of the Glacier Area and the Digimon Maze of Western Area, respectively. As you are questing, you are **not required** to do every quest on every map. For the quickest experience, you should focus on the main quests and high experience quests. If you do not have any main quests to continue with, you should start doing sub quests and daily quests at the most *recent NPC*, which should hopefully unlock the next main quest. As you complete the different area questlines, the PawnChessmon W NPC at DATS should have Area Completion quests that give you rewards which you can view [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/PawnChessmon_W_(Quest_Rewards)).

Several things to make note of as you're questing:
- Do not worry about balancing the experience between your starter and your journey digimon, focus on your starter first until they hit max level (120). Then swap and do the same with your journey digimon.
- As you are questing, don't forget to farm digimon seals. (What are seals? You should [read this](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Seal_Master))
	- In general, you should focus on collecting at least 500 seals of any digimon enemies that you come across. Do not feel pressured to farm field boss or dungeon boss seals yet. You will be able to farm those more efficiently later on.
	- For SK, you should focus on Attack (AT), HP, DS and SK seals.
	- For AA, you should focus on Attack (AT), Critical Chance (CT), HP, and Hit Rate (HT)
	- While you can certainly go for seals for the other stats, you shouldn't feel obligated to do so until you are far enough.
- A big part of your damage, besides your gear, comes from your active deck. (What are decks? [Here's a wiki page](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Deck_System))
	- Here's a provided [guideline](https://discord.com/channels/1371914476424527963/1403899517320822936/1403899517320822936) for deck progression based on ease and the benefits it provides to your class
		- Before you begin running content, you should at least have Omega (as SK) or Main Characters of the adventure (for AA) unlocked and equipped.
	- As you quest, you should come across many DigiEggs, some of which are needed for your class's decks. Don't be afraid to farm some eggs and their hatch data.
		- Hatch data can be obtained by scanning DigiEggs that have a description of 'RANK 1/DATA' or as a direct drop on certain maps.
	- Do not feel compelled to try and hatch every digimon for your decks at 5/5. Instead, focus on digimon with SSS and/or SSS+ evolutions to be 5/5. For the rest, it is sufficient to hatch them at 3/5.
		- Even if a Digimon later gets a SSS or SSS+ evolution, it is entirely possible to swap their size data with a newly hatched 5/5 using the [Data Exchange system](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_Exchange)

While you can continue with any of the 3 questlines, here is a recommended order:
- Continue with the File Island Questline that Elecmon teleports you to start at the Village of the Beginning. These quests give generally high experience that'll push your starter digimon to 100+ quite easily. Hold off on progressing to Server Continent, for now.
	- Make an active effort to complete the Novice Challenge quests as you're progressing. By the end of File Island, you should have up to "Koromon's Challenge - 3" completed.
	- Once you've completed Koromon's Challenge - 1, you'll be given a Novice Clothes Box, a Novice Smart School Uniform, and other items. Unless you are leveling or minmaxing your damage, the Novice Smart School Uniform (which is permanent) is more than sufficient to replace your other costumes once they expire. The Novice Clothes set are also very useful as you will not have any other meaningful set of clothes yet.
- Backtrack and complete the Glacier Area questline started by "Miki's Summons". While being one of the largest sets of quests, the area completion rewards make it worth it. Once you fully complete it, again backtrack and head to the Western Area.
	- As mentioned before, make sure to make an active effort to complete the Novice Challenge quests as you're progressing. For Tsunomon's Challenge - 2, you will have to travel out of your way to the Western Area's Dark Tower Wasteland.
	- By the end of the Glacier Questline, you should have all of Tsunomon's quests complete and move onto Gabumon's. At this point, you should have at least 15 Challenge Coins.
		- Head back to DMW Village and behind the Novice Challenge NPCs, you should find a Taichi NPC. Talk to him and exchange 15 Challenge Coins for the digiegg of the remaining starter digimon for your class in the DigiEgg Exchange:
			- AA: Lalamon
			- SK: Gaomon
- Start the Digimon Maze questline through the "Commander's Urgent Summon" quest and progress through the Digimon Maze. There are a lot of quests with repetitive tasks, so don't forget to take a break every now and again. If Maze is too much, it isn't a bad idea to skip ahead to Server Continent and come back to Maze to progress it further.
	- Once you fully complete the Digimon Maze questline, you'll unlock the Gizumon Lab dungeon that will be accessible at the Digimon Maze Entrance. The dungeons rewards focus on enhancing Starter Digimon, dropping [Savers] DigiClones, Transcendence Chip Exchange Tickets, and Skill DigiCodes (This item will be explained later) among other items. At 20 successful runs, you can exchange the 'Sparkling Savers' DigiSoul items for a Starter Digimon SSS item.
	- You should also take the time to run back to the PawnChessmon W NPC at DATS and grab the reward from both Glacier Area completion and Maze Completion: A Growth Fruit [Savers]. This will bump up your second starter to 125%, giving them access to Transcendence once you've got the materials.
- If you haven't already, continue on from File island to the Server Continent questline. This questline is pretty straightforward and should be pretty easy to complete with a level 100+ Digimon. By the end of this questline, either your first starter or your journey digimon (potentially both) should be level 120 or close to.
	- If you're still paying attention to the Novice Questline, you should be able to complete Koromon's Challenge - 4 and push onwards right up to Greymon's Challenge - 1.

If you've been keeping up with the seals for your class and saving up your money, you should have 5T for Transcendence. Find an easy devil type digimon to farm Low Class Devil Data and collect 30 devil data to hatch the 2 5/5 Raremon DigiEggs from way earlier. Transcend your starter digimon then head back to Richard Sampson and clone their HP, You should be greeted with a nice pop-up on the top of the screen signaling that you've finally fully cloned your starter, making them entirely content-ready. For your journey Digimon, you can either buy the required Mid Class Dragon Transcendence ConvertChips from other players or the Cash Shop, or you can farm Low Class chips from non-Character Bound Mid Data craft at [Nanomon](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Nanomon_(Item_Craft)#Transcendence_ConvertChip) at DATS or various dungeons in the game.

At this point in time you now have 2 options:
- You can continue questing as you still have several questlines to begin and complete:
	- "A call" - This quest appears on your digivice when your digimon is level 100+. This will take you to Shinjuku which provides a lot of high experience quests, which is perfect for getting the second starter digimon boosted to Level 120. After finishing the Shinjuku Area, you can start the Digital Area questline.
		- With access to the Digital Area maps, you can also start the grind for your [Goggles](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Goggles), which give you a decent boost to your damage, but costs a grand total of 150T for max level. As an AA DPS, you'll want the AT/AT goggles. As a SK DPS, you'll want SK/SK.
	- "Anomalies are Detected, Investigation Required" - Richard Sampson should have this quest that'll direct you to the Versandi Terminal map and start the questline there. Be warned, the map does have an X-Program debuff that causes DoT and decreases digimon damage. The only methods to dispel this debuff is for the Omegamon Raid in Versandi to be killed, giving a damage buff that overwrites the debuff across the entire map, or to use an X-Digimon.
		- If you have LordKnightmon X as your journey digimon and plan to quest here, it is a worthwhile reason to use the 30D XAI you were given earlier. One of the later side quests gives a permanent XAI, giving you free access to the [X-Antibody evolutions](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/X-Antibody_System)(As long as you have X-Antibody items to fill it with)
		- Unfortunately, in order to complete the Versandi Terminal Questline, you will need to complete Royal Base (Normal). Do not feel compelled to complete the questline. Come back later once you have the stats.
	- You can also continue from the Server Continent questline into the Odaiba questline and, afterwards, the Spiral Mountain questline.
		- If you take this route, you will also be able to complete Gabumon's Challenge - 1 all the way to Garurumon's Challenge - 1
		- Once you progress into the Spiral Mountain areas, you'll be able to farm the materials to craft the first level of the [Spiral Keyring](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/KeyRing), an equipable gear item that starts out weak but gets stronger with each upgrade. However, besides the first upgrade, the keyring requires materials from the Spiral Mountain dungeons, endgame content that you will not be ready for yet.
- You can also opt to move into proper Early Game instead. While questing is important as you'll miss out on Area Completion rewards, you can also balance it with doing dungeons and keep yourself from being burned out.
	- Before moving into Early Game proper, make sure you have the 'Omega' deck unlocked and active (as SK) or the 'Main Characters of the adventure' deck (for AA)

# Early Game

Congratulations, you've officially moved on from preparing to do content to actually *doing* content.

Before we establish what your progression should look like, there's are four unmentioned, but important, mechanics: **The Tamer System**, **Accessory Enhancement**, **Skill Levels**, and **Memory Skills**

### Tamer System
- The [Tamer System](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Tamer_system) can be split up into 3 separate sections: Tamer Cosmetics, Tamer Passive Skills, and Tamer Skills
	- Tamer Cosmetics -
		- When a player uses a Tamer Exchange item and unlocks the passive (or changes their tamer), they can go to their Tamer stat screen and click "Change Tamer" to change the visual appearance of their Tamer to any other Tamer unlocked.
		- You can also buy Tamer Coins from the Cash Shop to exchange for skins on certain tamers, such as the DATS Uniform for Marcus or the Summer Outfit for Yoshida
	- Passive Skill System -
		- Once a Tamer's Passives are unlocked, when you open the Tamer stat window and go to the "Skill" Tab, you can click on the "Passive Skill System" button to freely change your tamer skill passives.
		- This will change the Tamer Skill passives to the selected Tamer **as well as** the active Tamer Skill.
			- For example, if you switch to Matt's Passives, you will gain all of his passives skills and your standard Tamer Skill will switch to Vigor
	- Tamer Skills -
		- Besides the one Tamer skill that comes with the tamer passives you have selected, you can also have two other tamer skills at your disposal. 
		- To obtain these, you need to use Enhanced/Reinforced Tamer Skill items (or the Ultimate Tamer Skill items). These Tamer Skills are "rentals" however, and will eventually expire
			- While you can only have two rental skills active at once, you can freely delete any that haven't expired yet and store them in case you would like to have a different rental skill active.
			- Your non-expired (but used) rental skills can be found in the "Tamer Skill System" menu of the "Skill" tab of the Tamer stat window.
		- Some non-rental and rental tamer skills stack with one another:
			- For Example, Berserker and Enhanced/Ultimate Berserker can both be active on one digimon.
			- While you can have an Enhanced/Reinforced Rental Skill and an Ultimate Rental Skill of the same kind equipped at the same time, they do not stack.
				- For example, Enhanced Berserker and Ultimate Berserker *do not* stack and will overwrite one another if cast at the same time.
	- Recommended Combinations for high DPS:
		- For SK - Matt Passives, Enhanced/Ultimate Vigor, Reinforced/Ultimate Focus **OR** Reinforced/Ultimate Saikyou
		- For AA - Ruli Passives (if needing HT) **OR** Tai Passives, Enhanced/Ultimate Berserker, Enhanced/Ultimate Analysis

### Accessory Enhancement
- [Accessories (Earrings, Necklaces, Bracelets, Rings and *some* Digivices)](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Clothing#Accessories) can typically be enhanced and/or changed using 3 items:
	- Option Change Stone (OCS) - This will re-roll the stat options on a piece of gear. Up to 3 stats can be "locked", but the stone cost of rerolling increases proportionally.
	- Number Change Stone (NCS) - This will re-roll the stat number of a chosen stat option on a piece of gear. Thanks to DMW-exclusive Quality of Life, a stat number will *not* go down when re-rolled, but also is not guaranteed to go up.
	- Digitary Power Stone - This will increase the Digitary Power of a piece of gear. The Digitary Power determines the amount of stats given by a piece of gear. The max number is typically 200%. There are 3 types of Digitary Power Stones: normal Digitary Power Stones (+1% if successful, -1% if failed), Shiny Digitary Power Stones (+3% if successful, -2% if failed), and Amazing Digitary Power Stones (Guaranteed +10%).
- In order to use OCS or NCS, you need "Digiable Power Renewal Number".  Every 1 stone costs 1 renewal number. For example, if an option reroll costs 91 Option Change Stones, you need 91 Digiable Power Renewal Number to reroll. In order to increase this number, you need to use Renewal Increase Stones. Similar to Digitary Power Stones, there are three tiers: normal Renewal Increase Stones (a chance of +1 renewal), High Rank Renewal Increase Stones (guaranteed +1 renewal), and Amazing Renewal Increase Stones (guaranteed +5 renewal)
- You can find the first two tiers of Digitary Power Stones and the normal Renewal Increase Stone at the [QueenChessmon NPC's shop at DATS](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/QueenChessmon_(NPC)). Amazing Renewal Increase Stones and Amazing Digitary Power Stones are drops in some dungeons as well the Colosseum Exchange
- Some accessories, such as the Spiral KeyRing and D-Arks, have set stat options, numbers and, potentially even Digitary Power. Generally, these accessories will have 0 Digiable Renewal Increase Numbers when crafted and/or opened.
- Each class has a different "perfect" set of options on accessories for maximum damage.
	- The following are the perfect sets, ordered from most important to least important. These "perfect" option sets *do not* apply for Spiral Mountain gear.
		- You should not aim for perfect stats unless you intend to hold onto your gear for a substantial amount of time. It is a much better use of your resources to go for "Semi-Perfect" (3 out of 4 options) until you reach Lv.10 Fanglongmon gear/Ultimate Fanglongmon gear. For Bracelet, this should be with the Royal : X-Knight Bracelet, if resources permit.
	- For SK DPS:
		- Earring - Basic Attribute, Basic Attribute, Skill, Skill
		- Necklace - Basic Attribute, Basic Attribute, Skill, Max HP
		- Bracelet - Skill, Skill, Max HP, Max HP, Max DS 
		- Ring - Basic Attribute, Basic Attribute, Skill, Skill
		- Note: Critical Damage/Hit Rate is excluded due to the fact that SK Digimon do not use Auto Attacks in later content.
	- For AA DPS:
		- Earring - Critical Damage, Critical Damage, Basic Attribute, Basic Attribute
		- Necklace - Attack Speed, Critical Damage, Basic Attribute, Basic Attribute
		- Bracelet - Critical Damage, Critical Damage, Hit Rate, Hit Rate, Attack
		- Ring - Attack, Attack, Basic Attribute, Basic Attribute

### Skill Levels
- Every Digimon, when initially hatched, only has a maximum skill level of 10 for each of its skills on each evolution. You gain skill points by killing enemies that you gain experience from, which increases your skill mastery for **that specific evolution and any unlocked evolutions.** Be warned, you gain less skill experience on higher evolutions, so be prepared to grind for a bit.
- You can increase the maximum skill level **for that specific evolution** using [Skill Digicode](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Skill_DigiCode) items. The increased maximum skill levels do not transfer between evolutions, so be careful on what evolutions you decide to use them on.
	- You cannot increase the amount of skill points you have at your disposal. You will always end up with a maximum of 76 Skill Points. 
	- For SK, this often means that unlocking level 25 will create a division of 72 points invested in their most powerful skill (Typically the F3) and 4 points invested in their lowest cooldown skill (Typically F1)
- For AA Digis, skill levels are generally unimportant as they will not do much damage for you. If you do use skills (Such as those on SSS+ like BloomLord), you will often be using it for the buff it gives your digimon rather than the actual damage.
	- Exceptions exist such as Gankoomon X (SSS) and Diarbbitmon (SSS) who have a buff that increases with skill level.
	- If an AA Digimon has a 'gimmick' such as Damage over Time (DoT) or Area of Effect (AoE), it may sometimes be worth to increase the skill level to make the 'gimmick' stronger and/or viable in later content.

### Memory Skills
- Memory Skills are optional, but highly recommended, skills that can be added to a digimon evolution, granting them unique effects.
	- They do not transfer between evolutions. If you put a Memory Skill on Gabumon, it will not be accessible on Garurumon and vice versa.
	- For a more in-depth and proper explanation, see [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Memory_Skills)
- Memory Skills take Memory Chip items to use, which can be bought from most Vending Machine NPC shops across the various maps.
	- The most "convenient" one is the Vending Machine in DATS Center.
- They are split into 3 Groups: Offensive, Defensive and Support skills
	- Offensive Skills can be sub-classed into 2 broad groups: "Rulers" and "Emperors"
		- All Elements have a "Ruler" and an "Emperor" variation. For example, "Ruler of Darkness" only applies when the digimon using the skill is a Darkness-attribute digimon
			- Attributes also have a "Ruler" and an "Emperor" skill, but the "Rulers" are instead called "Master", such as "Vaccine Master". Attribute Emperors are still "Emperors", such as "Vaccine Emperor".
			- The Attribute Memory Skills are weaker compared to the Element Memory Skills
				- For example, Ruler of Darkness Highest/Lv.4 is a 20% increase, while Vaccine Master Highest/Lv.4 is 15%.
		- Rulers are Skill Damage increasing Memory Skills, while Emperors are Critical Damage increasing Memory Skills.
			- Unfortunately for AA DPS, Emperors are not that good to use (at the time of this guide's writing) and should not be aimed for.
		- Outside of the Rulers and Emperors, they also exists "Last Effort", but unfortunately due to the strict conditions of the Skill, it is a very situational Memory Skill to have and use.
	- Defensive Skills all give damage reduction to the Digimon that activates them. Similar to "Rulers"/"Emperors", there are Attribute and Element-specific defensive memory skills. Attribute-specific defensive skills are known as "Defender" skills.
		- There also exists a "Last Effort" counterpart known as "Iron Will", however it is also very situational, just like Last Effort.
		- There also exists the "Provocation" Memory Skill, but it is exclusive to Tanks (and arguably harder to use.)
	- Support Skills vary in effect entirely, providing healing, increasing max hp and max ds temporarily, or increasing evasion/movement speed.
		- Despite their limited variety, 3 of the skills ("Speeding", "Quick Movements" and "Narrow Escape") are considered useless due to their situational usage.
- When it comes to the question of "What Memory Skills should I put on my digimon?", it largely depends on the class and use case.
	- For SK -
		- A corresponding Ruler to the Digimon's Element
			- You can opt for a high level "Master" instead of a Ruler, as a "Master" skill tends to be cheaper in the player market.
		- Tree of Life (For Max HP and Max DS increase) or Hand of Healing (for group healing)
	- For AA -
		- A corresponding Guardian to the Digimon's Element
			- You can similarly opt for a "Defender" instead of a Guardian due to the generally lower price compared to a Guardian.
			- While you can opt for an Emperor instead, the damage increase is usually not worth compared to the survivability increase.
		- Tree of Life (For Max HP and Max DS increase) or Hand of Healing (for group healing)

### Boss Mechanic General Guide

Most bosses in the game follow a similar mechanical design, This is *not* 100% accurate to the entire game as certain bosses have different symbolism for their mechanics.
- Split: These are typically indicated by big, blue circles around one (or more) players that move with the player. Damage taken is *increased* for each player within the circle.
- Stack: These are typically indicated by small, orange circles around the player that move with the player. Damage taken is *decreased* for each player within the circle.
- Poison: These are typically indicated by large, orange circles around the player that moves with them. When cast, they leave a pool of poison where the circle was indicated for some time.
- "Meteor": These are usually indicated by an orange circle that doesn't move with the player. They can vary with size, but generally disappear after the skill is cast.
- "Green Circle": What occurs during this mech varies with each boss, however the indicator is that one (or more) small green circles will spawn around the boss. Aim to stand inside one of the green circle.
- "Blue Circles": These are usually indicated by a large amount of giant blue circles spawning all around the boss. Avoid standing in the blue circles to avoid taking damage.
- "Feel the Pain!": This mechanic is named after the text that normally accompanies it. Whoever is tanking the boss at that moment is attacked with a lightning bolt that will chain to any nearby players, increasing the damage to every player hit. When this mech goes off, ensure you are all separated.
- "Omae wa moe shindeiru wo": This mechanic is named after the text that normally accompanies it. A reference to the Fist of the North Star anime, the boss dishes out an extremely high amount of undodgeable damage.
- Tank Buster: This mechanic is indicated by a giant orange circle that looks similar to a clock. Anyone inside the circle gets hit for massive damage. Implied by the name, this mechanic is targeted towards the tanking player.
- DPS Check: This mechanic often doesn't have any text indicators and usually starts at 10%. There are several variations:
	- Tank-Stat Check - The Boss gains a large damage increase that takes out large chunks of the tanking player's HP. If the tank isn't strong enough, or the DPSes aren't strong enough, the team is wiped by auto attacks. The only time limit is the capabilities of the tank.
	- Standard DPS Check - Typically, the boss will stop all mechanics and go inactive. If the Boss is not killed in time, it will kill the entire party at once.
	- Minion DPS Check - Typically the boss summons one or more minions and gains heavy damage reduction and/or gives out a debuff on the party. 
		- If you get a debuff, you will typically have to kill the right enemy to dispel the debuff, then kill the boss before the party is wiped.
		- If the boss summons several minions, you must kill the minions and use the item they give you on the boss to kill it.

### Content Progression

Now that you're ready to progress further, open your Underworld Gear. You've now got 30 Days to acquire more permanent and worthwhile gear. Here are the best ways to make use of it:
- (Optional but Recommended) Farm the Gizumon Lab Dungeon at Digimon Maze Entrance to enhance your second starter and obtain a usable Data SSS.
	- You can craft Gizumon Lab passes with 100 Spare parts at the Gizumon NPC at Digimon Maze Entrance. Spare parts drop from any digimon at the Digimon Maze maps (Digimon Maze Entrance included)
- Farm the normal difficulty Holy Beast Dungeons -
	- [Scar of Water Crystal (EDGN)](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Scar_of_Water_Crystal) - This dungeon has 1 of each attribute digimon as bosses. Due to the final boss, Xuanwumon, being a VA, you should take your starter for the neutral status.
		- If you have your second starter nearly fully enhanced, you should take them instead as you will get the advantage on Xuanwumon.
		- You can make EDGN passes by using 100 Scar Essence at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Scar Essence can be farmed at any mob in Glacier Area.
	- [Uprising Flame (ZDGN)](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Uprising_Flame) - This dungeon has 3 Vaccine Bosses with a Virus as the final boss. Despite the earlier 3 Vaccines, it's better to take a Vaccine for Zhuqiaomon at the end.
		- If you're SK, you should aim to get the Normal/Flame Gear from here to replace your Underworld gear once it runs out.
			- The distinction between Flame Gear and Normal Zhuqiaomon gear is that Flame Gear does *not* require Number Change Stones as the Numbers will always be max.
		- You should be careful due to both Phoenixmon and Zhuqiaomon having a Return (Damage Reflection) mechanic. In order to cure the debuff, they will summon smaller mobs that, when killed, dispel the debuff.
		- You can make ZDGN passes by using 100 Piece [Uprising Flame] at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Piece [Uprising Flame] can be farmed at any mob in File Island.
	- [Trace of Black Steel (BDGN)](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Trace_of_Black_Steel) - This dungeon is 3 Data Bosses. As such, it is highly recommended to take a Virus.
		- Before you attack the boss, you should destroy the towers. They will aggro you and, once aggro'd, will give buffs to the bosses. These buffs can be re-casted on the bosses, refreshing their time and increasing the buff the boss receives.
		- You can make BDGN passes by using 100 Energy of Steel at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Energy of Steel can be farmed at any mob in Server Continent.
	- [Descending Thunder God (QDGN)](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Descending_Thunder_God) - This dungeon is 4 Data Bosses. As such, it is highly recommended to take a Virus.
		- If you're AA, you should aim to get the Normal/Radiant Gear from here to replace your Underworld gear once it runs out.
			- The distinction between Radiant Gear and Normal Qinglongmon gear is that Radiant gear does *not* require Number Change Stones as the numbers will always be max.
		- Qinglongmon's mechanics are generally simple, however he does have a hidden aspect to his "Feel the Pain" skill. "Feel the Pain" is chain lightning, increasing with damage as it hits each player. Therefore, players should separate if the skill does come out.
		- You can make QDGN passes by using 100 Energy of Thunder God at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Energy of Thunder God can be farmed at any mob in the Digimon Maze (excluding Digimon Maze Entrance).
- (Optional, but recommended) Start running [Digimon Arena](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Digimon_Arena) (Colosseum/Colo)
	- Despite being considered one of the most unfun pieces of content in the game, Colo has a lot of progression-helping items such as BM Items, Amazing Renewal Increase Stones, Amazing Digitary Power Stones, OCS, NCS and more in the Exchange.
	- You can run it up to twice a day.
	- Do not do Hero Mode (Dux/Dukemon NPC) or EX (Examon X NPC). You will not be strong enough and you *will* waste one of your runs.
	- There are 40 rounds.
		- Rounds 1-35 should be doable without switiching using a VA digimon.
			- Round 27 may pose an issue, depending on your DPS. If need be, switch to a Vi Digimon.
			- Rounds 31-34 are the Odaiba Raid boss pairs. Focus on one first then target the other. Do not try to kill both at the same time.
		- Round 36's boss, Xuanwumon, may give some trouble, thus you may need a DA Digimon.
		- Round 37 is Zhuqiaomon. As mentioned for ZDGN, be careful as he may hit cast his debuffing skill, which can give you the Return debuff.
		- Round 38-40 is Qinglongmon, Baihumon and Fanglongmon, all Data bosses. You will need a Vi Digimon for these 3. 

Once you've acquired Zhuqaiomon/Qinglongmon gear at Semi-Perfect strength, you can now move onwards to the last stretch of early game:
- Farm the Hard Holy Beast Dungeons/SSS Holy Beast Dungeons for Holy Beast/Radiant Holy Beast gear:
	- AA - It is technically possible to skip this step and move on straight to Fang gear, but is highly not recommended.
	- The Hard and SSS dungeons have different drops from the normal difficulty dungeons as well as a health increase on the bosses.
		- They only drop the accessories needed to craft their relevant piece of holy beast gear.
		- Qinglongmon drops all 3 Radiant Qing gear due to be used to upgrade the Lv.5 Holy Beast gear into Lv.5 Radiant Holy Beast gear. It also has a much higher crystal drop rate due to needing more crystals.
		- Radiant Holy Beast gear is an **upgrade** of standard Holy Beast gear. It does **not** have max numbers and requires Number Change Stones.
	- The SSS Holy Beast dungeons are recommended for farming the special crystals required.
	- You can craft the next set of gear: The Holy Beast/Radiant Holy Beast Gear at the[Digitamamon NPC](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Digitamamon_(Item_Make)) at DATS Center.
	- [Scar of Water Crystal Hard](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Scar_of_Water_Crystal_(Hard_Mode))/[SSS](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Scar_of_Water_Crystal_(SSS)) (EDGH/SSS) - Ring
		- You can make EDGH/SSS passes by using 100 Scar Essence [Hard] at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Scar Essence [Hard] can be farmed at any mob on the Valley of Light map of the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
	- [Uprising Flame Hard](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Uprising_Flame_(Hard_Mode))/[SSS](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Uprising_Flame_(SSS)) (ZDGH/SSS) - Necklace
		- You can make ZDGH/SSS passes by using 100 Piece [Uprising Flame] \[Hard] at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Piece [Uprising Flame] \[Hard] can be farmed at any mob on the Shibuya map of the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
	- [Trace of Black Steel Hard](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Trace_of_Black_Steel_(Hard_Mode))/[SSS](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Trace_of_Black_Steel_(SSS)) (BDGH/SSS) - Earring
		- You can make BDGH/SSS passes by using 100 Energy of Steel at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Energy of Steel [Hard] can be farmed at any mob on the Minato City map of the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
	- [Descending Thunder God Hard](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Descending_Thunder_God_(Hard_Mode))/[SSS](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Descending_Thunder_God_(SSS)) (QDGH/SSS)
		- You can make QDGH/SSS passes by using 100 Energy of Thunder God at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Energy of Thunder God [Hard] can be farmed at any mob on the Odaiba map of the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
- Once you've acquired Radiant Holy Beast gear at Semi-Perfect, you should begin farming [Royal Base [Normal]](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Royal_Base) (RBN) for the Royal : X-Knight Bracelet.
	- This dungeon is not short by any means. It does take a decent amount of time.
	- Assuming the final boss, Dexmon, drops 3 memories each time, you only need approximately 20 runs total to craft a Royal : X-Knight Bracelet, assuming you obtain a Yggdrasil's Records item within those 20 runs.
	- It is highly recommended to take a Vaccine attribute digimon as the second and third boss rooms are only Virus attribute digimon. 
	- As long as you are still using your Vaccine starter SSS, you will need X-Protector items otherwise you will be hit with the X-Program debuff. These are obtainable from some Sub Quests/Daily Quests in Versandi Terminal.
	- You can craft RBN passes by using 100 Warp Energy at the Magnamon X NPC in Versandi Terminal. Warp Energy can be farmed at any mob on the Versandi Terminal map.

Before you move onto Mid game, you should ensure that you have the accessories and decks:
- Accessory-wise, Radiant Holy Beast Lv.5 gear and the Royal : X-Knight Bracelet, all semi-perfect.
- As an AA DPS, your current deck should be 'Our Final Evolution'. As a SK DPS, your current deck should be 'Forsaken Strain'
- If you haven't been keeping up with your seals, make sure you get most of the overworld farmable ones to 1k (or 3k if you have the resources)

# Mid Game

Now that you've moved forward into Mid Game, you have two new tasks you can now do:
- Run [Digimon Arena Hero Mode](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Digimon_Arena#Round_Rewards_Colosseum_Hero_Mode/Extreme_Mode) (Colo Hero)
	- Unlike Colo Normal Mode, Hero is 15 rounds of more mechanic-heavy bosses. You also do not lose points upon failure, making it worthwhile to always check if you can clear the next round. Talk to the Dux NPC to start the Hero difficulty.
	- Ensure both of your starter digimon and your journey digimon are fully leveled and cloned. You will need a VA, DA and Vi Digimon to complete Colo Hero.
	- As you complete Round 10 to Round 15, you will receive Boxes that contain Ranking Points and Supreme Evolution Summon Cards (v1 and v2).
		- These cards are used for Susanoomon Shin/Omegamon X (v1) and Fanglongmon Shin/Examon X (v2).
		- Until you have Fanglongmon Gear, however, you will have limited content to use them in as you will be lacking damage. Therefore, I do not fully recommend focusing on obtaining them until later.
	- Round Mechanics:
		- Rounds 1 through 4 are simple in mechanics. Some boss' damage circles may give out debuffs such as damage reduction or Return, therefore pay close attention if you got hit.
		- Round 5's boss, Apocalymon, mainly uses circles until 30%.
			- At 30%, he will become immune to damage and cast 10 meteors in a row at every player. After this, he will cast 10 poison circles in a row on each player. Once this has finished, a Piedmon enemy will spawn. Hit the Piedmon and stand inside the circle it casts on itself.
				- If you do not do this, you will get instantaneously killed by Apocalymon after a few seconds.
		- Round 6 through 8 return to simple mechanics.
		- Round 9, Mastemon, is pretty simple. She only has poison circles and a special mechanic at 50% and 30%.
			- At 50%, she summons a LadyDevimon and an Angewomon mob. The LadyDevimon mob has extremely high HP and is unkillable, while the Angewomon mob is very weak and killable. Kill the Angewomon to receive an item that, when used on the LadyDevimon, instantly kills it.
			- At 30%, she repeats the mechanic but summons 2 LadyDevimons/Angewomons.
		- Round 10, Millenniummon, mainly casts different meteor circles and has a special mechanic at 30%
			- At 30%, he will cast giant poison circles on each player. It is recommended to drop the poisons in each corner of the map to give enough space for the second part of this mech.
			- After he casts the poison, he will do 10 split-stack circles in a row. The visual indicators on these attacks are **meant to trick you**. There's a special order, regardless of the circle type.
				- Split -> Split -> Stack -> Stack -> Stack -> Split -> Stack -> Split -> Stack -> Split
		- Round 11 through 13 have simple mechanics again, but hit much harder than the previous rounds.
			- If you do not have the HP and or DE to take a hit, it may be worth having a tank in your party.
		- **Round 14 and 15 require a Tank. Without a Tank, you will all drop like flies at this level of progression.**
		- Round 14, Examon X, has a field effect during his round: All players take 200 DoT until he is defeated.
			- At around 55% and 35%, Examon X will cast "Dodge This!" without any visual indicators. This is a Nuke attack that deals high damage to all players.
			- At 10%, all of his mechanics stop and he summons Slayerdramon and Breakdramon. Kill them and the top DPS of each gets an item that, when used on Examon X, dishes out high damage and should kill him (Sometimes you need to do a little extra damage). If you do not kill them in time, Examon X wipes the entire team.
		- Round 15, Ordinemon, also has a field effect during her round: Block is reduced.
			- Her mechanics are pretty simple and obvious.
			- At 50%, she has "fake circles" similar to Millenniummon. Her sequence is Stack -> Split -> Stack -> Stack -> Split -> Split
			- At 40%, most of her mechanics change to being focused on the Tank. DPSes should stay stacked on her and focus on killing.
			- At 10%, all of her mechanics stop. She gains high damage reduction and a 100% attack buff. This DPS check requires that you kill her before your tank dies.
- Farm [Boundaries of Yin and Yang](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Boundaries_of_Yin_and_Yang)/[Boundaries of Yin and Yang SSS](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Boundaries_of_Yin_and_Yang_(SSS)) (FDG/FDGSSS)
	- While the drops are slightly different between the two, there is no substantial difference between them like the Hard Holy Beast Dungeons and the SSS Holy Beast Dungeons
		- With that said, I highly recommend doing the SSS version of FDG. It is designed around properly doing the mechanics and is more accessible since you don't have SSS+ yet.
	- Before you face off against Fanglongmon, You must face all 4 Holy Beasts.
		- For the 4 Holy Beasts, they have all of their mechanics from their Hard Dungeon counterparts. For example, Baihumon has the 3 Towers from his boss fight.
		- As an added mechanic, you are afflicted with 3 debuffs that correspond to their 3 subordinates that, in total, decrease your damage by 70%. Kill the 3 subordinates to dispel the debuff for all players in the area.
			- The debuffs do come back eventually, but the boss will respawn his minions around the same time as well.
	- Fanglongmon's fight takes place on a different map after defeating Qinglongmon. Unlike the 4 Holy Beasts, he does not have any field debuffs.
	- All of Fanglongmon's mechanics are obvious and straightforward.
	- In order to make a full set of Lv.10 Fanglongmon's Ancient Gear, you need the following:
		- Ring - 
			- 3 Sealed Xuanwumon Ring
			- 5 Ring of Sealed Zhuqiaomon
			- 3 Ring of Sealed Baihumon
			- 3 Qinglongmon's Sealed Ring
			- 145 Fanronkou
		- Necklace -
			- 3 Sealed Xuanwumon Necklace
			- 5 Necklace of Sealed Zhuqiaomon
			- 3 Necklace of Sealed Baihumon
			- 3 Qinglongmon's Sealed Necklace
			- 145 Fanronkou
		- Earring - 
			- 5 Earring of Sealed Zhuqiaomon
			- 5 Earring of Sealed Baihumon
			- 5 Qinglongmon's Sealed Earring
			- 145 Fanronkou
	- If you wish to upgrade one of the Lv.10 Ancient Gear to Ultimate Ancient Gear, you will need the corresponding piece of Divine Holy Beast gear and 20 Fanronkou
		- Divine Holy Beast gear is the upgrade after Radiant Holy Beast Lv.5. In order to craft it, you need to acquire a Divine Crystal from FDG, which is a rare drop from Fanglongmon.
		- The only difference between the non-Ultimate Ancient Gear and the Ultimate Ancient Gear is that Ultimate Ancient Gear does not require Number Change Stones as the numbers are always at max. However, the Spiral Mountain dungeon gear *does* require Ultimate Ancient Gear.
	- You can craft FDG/FDG SSS passes by using 100 Yin and Yang Spirit at the Renamon NPC in D-Terminal. Yin and Yang Spirit can be farmed at any mob on the Versandi Terminal map.

**Fanglongmon's Ancient Gear/Fanglongmon's Ultimate Ancient Gear is the hard bottleneck between the beginning of midgame and the rest of the game (Until the Spiral Mountain dungeons). It is highly recommended to complete your fang gear grind before pressing forward any further.**

Now that you've acquired Fanglongmon gear, a large portion of the game has now opened up for you. Here on out, you have several tasks to progress:
- Acquire your (Free) SSS+:
	- For SK -
		- My recommended order: Susanoomon Shin -> Omegamon Alter-B -> Fanglongmon Shin
			- Despite their placement in the game, the Tokyo-Odaiba dungeons required for the True Digivce for SK DPS are extremely poorly balanced. Without a Fang gear SSS+ or a Tank, it's almost guaranteed you will die. This makes VA and/or Vi SSS+ *invaluable* to SK DPS Progression.
			- While it is possible to go for Omegamon Alter-B first, the vast majority of random parties look for SSS+ DPS, rather than SSS DPS. Susanoomon Shin is also technically the most accessible as he only requires Colo Hero.
		- Susanoomon Shin guide [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Advanced_Spirit_System). Keep in mind, you will also need base [Susanoomon](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Susanoomon) as well.
			- Susanoomon Shin requires 90 Supreme Evolution Summon V1 Cards.
				- Colo Hero gives 1 card per round starting on Round 10, for a total of 6 cards per successful Round 15, or 12 cards for a "Perfect" day
				- Colo Extreme gives 1 card on Round 1 and Round 2. Round 3 to 6 gives 2 cards per round. For a full Round 6 run, this gives 10 cards or 20 cards for a "Perfect" day.
		- Omegamon Alter-B guide located [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Omegamon_Alter-B). If you obtained the Omega deck earlier on, you should have the requisite digimon, Omegamon Alter-S.
			- Collecting the components for the Alpha part (Sample A) requires you to clear the [Berserk Arena](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Berserk_Arena) dungeon.
				- Unlike most Dungeons,  it requires 2 tanks and 2 dps. You will be fighting two bosses at the same time: Omegamon Alter-S and Omegamon Zwart.
				- 1 DPS and 1 Tank should be Vaccine. The other DPS and Tank should be Data. The Vaccine DPS and Tank will take on Alter-S, the Data DPS and Tank will take on Zwart.
				- The Bosses are linked to a limited extent. Every 20%, starting at 80%, the bosses will summon a minion and give a debuff onto the Tank and DPS that increases the damage they take and reflects any damage they do on the boss back onto them. In order to dispel the debuff, the **other side** must kill their minion.
					- Keep in mind, if you do not time your minion kills correctly, you will effectively fail the run due to one side being unable to clear their debuff.
		- Fanglongmon Shin guide located [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Fanglongmon_(Shin)). Keep in mind, akin to Susanoomon Shin, you will need base Fanglongmon as well.
			- Fanglongmon Shin requires 200 Supreme Evolution Summon V2 Cards.
				- Colo Hero gives 1 card per round from Round 10 to Round 13. Round 14 and 15 gives 2 cards each for a total of 8 cards per successful Round 15, or 16 cards for a "Perfect" day
				- Colo Extreme gives 1 card on Round 1 and Round 2. Round 3 to 6 gives 2 cards per round. For a full Round 6 run, this gives 10 cards per successful Round 6 or 20 cards for a "Perfect" day.
				- Due to being able to collect cards in Colo Hero, it is possible to get Fanglongmon Shin before getting Alter-B
	- For AA -
		- Recommended order: BloomLordmon -> DarknessBagramon
			- At the time of this guide's writing, AA does not have a Data SSS+ available.
		- BloomLordmon (guide [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:BloomLordmon)) requires running the solo dungeon, [Shopping Mall](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Shopping_Mall), a minimum of 15 successful times as well as leveling and sacrificing 40 Palmon (Original). Make note, BloomLordmon can drop up to 3 eggs per successful run.
			- With semi-perfect Fang gear and the same deck from the end of early game, you should easily be able to clear without issue.
		- After obtaining BloomLordmon, run the 4-player dungeon [Bagramon's Domain](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Bagramon%27s_Domain) for DarknessBagramon (guide [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:DarknessBagramon)) as your Virus SSS+. Similar to BloomLordmon, you will need at least 15 successful runs. **You will need a tank.**
- Go for a proper Digivice:
	- For SK - 
		- As a SK DPS, you gain the most damage from the Royal Digivice, True Digivice, and True Digivice (Advanced).
			- While you can acquire the Royal Digivice as a quest reward from the Novice Challenge (MetalGreymon's Challenge - 1), it is also obtainable from the boxes given by the Royal Knights' Dominion daily quest from the Magnamon NPC in Versandi Terminal.
				- It does not have a high drop rate from the boxes so you shouldn't rely on them too heavy.
		- True Digivice (guide [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/True_Vice)) requires that you farm Tokyo-Odaiba raid bosses for the materials they can drop.
			- Instead of farming the raid bosses, you can also do the [Rainbow Bridge](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Rainbow_Bridge) dungeon for the Powder of Evolution item. With 2 Powder of Evolution, you can craft 1 of any raid boss material.
			- At a certain level of craft, you will need to start doing the Tokyo-Odaiba dungeons, Tokyo Tower Observatory, Fuji TV Rooftop, and Venomous Vortex.
				- All 3 dungeons have farmable passes. These passes are craftable at the Hikari NPC on the Odaiba map of the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
					- You can craft Tokyo-Tower Observatory passes by using 100 Observatory Energy, which can be farmed at any mob on the Valley of Light map in the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
					- You can craft Fuji TV Rooftop passes by using 100 Rooftop Energy, which can be farmed at any mob on the Shibuya map in the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
					- You can craft Venomous Vortex passes by using 100 Venomous Energy, which can be farmed at any mob on the Tokyo Tower or Minato City maps in the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
				- The dungeons accessed by Pixiemon are required for True Digivice (Advanced), not the base True Digivice.
				- As mentioned prior, it is pretty much a *requirement* to have Susanoomon Shin (or any other VA SSS+) and/or Omegamon Alter-B (or any other Vi SSS+) to complete the dungeons due to their poor balancing.
				- If you do not want to do all of them individually, you can collect take the Tokyo Tokens gained from clearing the dungeons to the Hikari NPC in Odaiba. You can craft the dungeon materials at a cost of 10 tokens. 
		- Once you've acquired the True Digivice and have all 3 SSS+, you can start doing the [True Digivice (Advanced)](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/True_Vice_Advanced) grind.
			- You will need to run the [Path of Bravery](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Path_of_Bravery), [Path of Friendship](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Path_of_Friendship) and [Venomous Vortex [Hard]](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Venomous_Vortex_(Hard))dungeons. **These dungeons all require a tank.**
				- The dungeon drops 2 of the required materials per clear, 1 non-Character Bound and 1 Character Bound.
					- If you choose to keep the 1 non-Character Bound, you only need to do 50 of each dungeon, or 150 dungeon runs total. 
					- If you choose to sell the non-Character Bound material, you will need to run each dungeon 100 times, or 300 dungeon runs total.
					- Expert Challenge - 3 of the Novice Challenge gives 20 of the Crest of Courage items and 20 Crest of Friendship items.
					- Expert Challenge - 4 of the Novice Challenge gives 20 of the Complete Virus items.
				- The only prerequisite material is an open True Digivice.
				- If you are running only free SSS+, you will need at least 3 True Digivice (Advanced).
				- All 3 dungeons have farmable passes. These passes are craftable at the Hikari NPC on the Odaiba map of the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
					- You can craft Path of Bravery passes by using 100 Bravery Energy, which can be farmed at any mob on the Odaiba map in the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
					- You can craft Path of Friendship passes by using 100 Friendship Energy, which can be farmed at any mob on the Odaiba map in the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
					- You can craft Venomous Vortex [Hard] passes by using 100 Vortex Energy, which can be farmed at any mob on the Big Sight map in the Tokyo-Odaiba Area.
	- For AA - 
		- As an AA DPS, you gain the most damage from the D-Ark and it's upgrades, the Rage D-Ark and Uncontrollable Rage D-Ark. D-Ark Guide [here](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/D-Ark_Vice)
		- For D-Ark Lv1 to Lv5, you must complete the [Vajramon Hard ](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Vajramon_Dungeon_(Hard)) and [Vikaralamon Hard](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Vikaralamon_Dungeon_(Hard)) dungeons. Each successful clear gives you the required materials for the D-Ark upgrades. Due to the balancing on these dungeons, you do not need SSS+ (and, at the time of this guide's writing, there is not a free Data AA SSS+)
			- Each dungeon clear gives you 30 non-Character Bound materials and 5 Character Bound materials. 
			- If you choose to sell the non-Character Bound materials, you need 72 runs of each dungeon, or 144 total runs.
			- If you choose to keep and convert the non-Character Bound materials, you only need 62 runs of each dungeon, or 124 total runs.
			- Advanced Challenge - 1 of the Novice Challenge gives 100 of each dungeon material.
			- You can craft both Vikaralamon Hard passes and Vajramon Hard passes at their respective PawnChessmon B NPCs.
				- At the PawnChessmon B NPC in Shinjuku East Area (Night), you can trade 100 Stadium Essence [Vajramon] for 1 Vajramon Hard pass. Stadium Essence [Vajramon] is farmable at any mob in both Shinjuku Western Area maps.
				- At the PawnChessmon B NPC in Shinjuku Western Area (Day), you can trade 100 Stadium Essence [Vikaralamon] for 1 Vikaralamon Hard pass. Stadium Essence [Vikaralamon] is farmabale at any mob in both Shinjuku East Area maps.
		- After getting BloomLordmon and acquiring the D-Ark Lv5, you'll be well equipped enough to take on the Digital Area dungeons for the Rage and Uncontrollable Rage D-Ark upgrades. **These dungeons all require a tank.**
			- Just like Vajra Hard and Vika Hard, they drop Character Bound and non-Character Bound materials per successful clear.
			- [Burning Battlefield](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Burning_Battle_Field) - You will need 300 total materials for both upgrades. If you keep and convert the non-CB items, you only have to run the dungeon 60 total times. If you choose to sell the non-CB items, you will need 100 total dungeon runs.
			- [Chaotic Battlefield](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Chaotic_Battle_Field) - You will need 150 total materials for both upgrades. If you keep and convert the non-CB items, you only have to run the dungeon 30 total times. If you choose to sell the non-CB items, you will need 50 total dungeon runs.
			- [Final Battle](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Final_Battle) - You will need 200 total materials for both upgrades. If you keep and convert the non-CB items, you only have to run the dungeon 40 total times. If you choose to sell the non-CB items, you will need 67 total dungeon runs.
			- Advanced Challenge - 2 of the Novice Challenge gives 20 of each dungeon material. 
			- You can craft passes for the 3 Digital Area dungeons at the Guilmon NPC at Zhuqiaomon's Restina Area in the Digital Area.
				- You can trade 100 Chaotic Essence for 1 Chaotic Battlefield pass. Chaotic Essence is dropped by any mob on the Wasteland Area, Wasteland Area (Night), and Cloud Area maps in the Digital Area.
				- You can trade 100 Burning Essence for 1 Burning Battlefield pass. Burning Essence is dropped by any mob on the Forest Area, Ocean Area and Four Holy Beast Area maps in the Digital Area.
				- You can trade 100 Final Essence for 1 Final Battle pass. Final Essence drops from any mob on the Collapsed Four Holy Beast Area, Zhuqiaomon's Resting Area, and Four Holy Beast Area (D-Reaper) maps in the Digital Area.
- Run [Digimon Arena Extreme Mode](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Digimon_Arena#Round_Rewards_Colosseum_Hero_Mode/Extreme_Mode) (Colo EX)
	- Colo EX is the hardest difficulty of Colo currently out and gives the most points as well. Talk to Examon X to start the EX difficulty.
	- EX is only 6 rounds, which are Rounds 10 to 15 of Colo Hero but more difficult. A tank is **absolutely a requirement**. The field effects of Examon X and Ordinemon are stronger than in Hero.
	- There are no mechanic differences, excluding Milleniummon who gains a new 50% mechanic.
		- At 50%, Millenniummon spawns two Ebemon mobs. Defeat the Ebemon quickly or your team will be instantly wiped.
			- Sometimes the Ebemon fail to spawn. If that occurs, continue attacking Millenniummon.
- Acquire proper Clothing:
	- At this point of the game, you should finally move on from the Novice Clothing (if you haven't already) to a proper set of clothing.
		- For SK -
			- The majority of your clothing (5 out of 6 pieces) comes from the [GreenZone NightSky](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/GreenZone_(Night)_(Guild)) guild dungeon. It has an 8 player capacity, but can only be done with guild members. 
				- You will need to acquire the Starmon's Ornament, Shoutmon's Cape, Dorulumon's Pants, Balistamon's Gloves and Sparrowmon's Shoes. These are non-CB and can be bought from other players as well.
				- When these 5 pieces are worn together, you gain a set bonus: 
					- Skill Damage 10% Increase
					- 1% Skill Damage Increase per 2000 Max DS
			- Your Clothes should look as follows:
				- Head - Starmon's Ornament
				- Fashion - Shoutmon's Cape
				- Top - Spooky Soulmon's Robe/Agumon Top/Swiming Gears - Life Vest/Back to School [Formal Robe]
					- The Spooky Soulmon's Robe and Agumon Top are generally obtainable as event rewards. However, the Agumon Top is buyable from the Cash Shop (via the Agumon Clothing Set)
				- Bottom - Dorulumon's Pants
				- Gloves - Balistamon's Gloves
				- Shoes - Sparrowmon's Shoes
		- For AA - 
			- The majority of your clothing (4 out of 6 pieces) comes from the Vajramon Hard dungeon.
				- You will need the Warrior Ornament, Warrior Top, Warrior Pants and Warrior Gloves, specifically the Shining Variant.
				- When these 4 Shining pieces are worn together, you gain a set bonus:
					- Critical Damage 20% Increase
					- 1% Critical Damage Increase per 1000 Max DS
			- Your Clothes should look as follows:
				- Head - Warrior Ornament [Shining]
				- Fashion - Rare Coin Cape
					- This is only in an ideal scenario. The Rare Coin Cape is a very rare item that is, otherwise, not that required for maximum DPS. Anything works in its place.
				- Top - Warrior Top [Shining]
				- Bottom - Warrior Pants [Shining]
				- Gloves - Warrior Gloves [Shining]
				- Shoes - Satan Shoes/Sparrowmon's Shoes/Any 2-slot 30% MS Shoes
					- Satan Shoes come from [Infinite Mountain Dungeon 2.0](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Infinite_Mountain_Dungeon_2.0), another guild dungeon.
					- As no shoes give a bonus that directly helps AA, you are free to use any 2-slot 30% Movement Speed shoes. You are only benefitting from the Movement Speed bonus, regardless.

Before you officially move onto endgame content, you should ensure that you are fully prepared:
- Accessory-wise, you should have perfect Fanglongmon Ancient Gear Lv.10/Fanglongmon Ultimate Ancient Gear Lv.10 with a perfect Royal : X-Knight Bracelet (For SK, the Max DS option is negligible). You should also have a fully maxed out pair of Goggles (AT/AT for AA, SK/SK for SK).
- You should have acquired proper clothing as well, see above.
- As an AA DPS, you should be using 'Judicium Noctis'. As a SK DPS, you should be using 'Celestfracture.'

# End Game

You have now hit the Endgame. At the time of this guide's writing, DMW's endgame is short and underdeveloped, therefore this part of the guide will not be written out. There are only 4 dungeons that are technically considered part of Endgame:
- [Royal Base [Hard]](https://digitalmastersworld.wiki.gg/wiki/Royal_Base_Hard) (RBH)
	- If you are not AA or have the AoA/Dexmon Shin Beta items, this dungeon is entirely skippable.
		- If you are AA, the Royal : Yggdrasil Bracelet is a worthwhile and powerful DPS upgrade. It also gives a 600 HT increase at Perfect, compared to the Royal : X-Knight Bracelet.
	- Room 1 and Room 2 are SSS-rank limited. Room 3 allows SSS+.
		- Room 1 has Examon X, Gankoomon X and Jesmon X. They are fought in a random order.
			- Examon X - Note-Worthy Mechanics:
				- @ 55% - "Omae wa mo shinderu" (You are already dead)
					- 70k Damage to the whole party.
				- @ 30% - Miko Mech
					- Multiple Kuzuhamon: Miko Mode spawn. When the Mikos are hit, they give a buff to nearby digimon. Without the buff, you will be instantly killed.
				- @ 10% - "Juggernaut Drive"
					- DPS Check
			- Jesmon X - Note-Worthy Mechanics:
				- @ 90% - Summons Portals (50s CD) "Portal Incoming"
					-  The Portals have extremely high Damage Reduction and require Damage Over Time (DoT) damage to kill them, such as Lilithmon X's F1 effect or Megidramon X's F1 effect.
				- @ 10% - Standard DPS Check
			- Gankoomon X - Note-Worthy Mechanics:
				- @ 50% - 50% Attack Buff
				- @ 10% - 100% Attack Buff
		- Room 2 has three bosses: Dukemon X, Lordknightmon X and DexDorugoramon
			- Dukemon X and Lordknightmon X are fought one after another by taking the left portal. They are free bosses, as they do little damage and have no mechs. They can be skipped.
			- DexDorugoramon - Note-Worthy Mechanics:
				- @ 98%/68%/38% - Egg Mechanic
					- At these percentages, DexDorugoramon spawns an Egg.
					- The Egg has damage reduction for 10s. After damage reduction, Egg casts a debuff on the digi that has aggro.
						- 2 stacks of the debuff does 100k DoT, effectively instantly killing most digimon.
					- If a player dies, an extra egg is spawned. This only happens once.
					- If the egg is left alive for 1 minute, the entire party is wiped.
				- @ 62%/22% - "Omae wa mo shinderu" (You are already dead)
					- 70k Damage to the whole party.
				- @ 50% - Split-Stack Attack (Similar to Millenniummon/Ordinemon mechanic)
					- Order: Stack -> Split -> Stack -> Stack -> Split -> Split
				- @ 35% - Drops big poison circles on 2 random players.
				- @ 10% - Standard DPS Check
		- Room 3 has two bosses: Dexmon, Alphamon then Alphamon Ouryuken Awaken
			- Dexmon - Note-Worthy Mechanics:
				- @ 80%/22% - "Omae wa mo shinderu" (You are already dead)
					- 70k Damage to the whole party
				- @ 70% - Dexmon summons Yggdrasil Core
					- Every 15 seconds, Yggdrasil Core summons a horde of DexDoruGreymon. Each DexDoruGreymon does a lot of damage.
					- Take a short cooldown AoE digimon such as Susanoomon Shin (SK) or BloomLordmon (AA) to take out the DexDoruGreymon as soon as they spawn. 
				- @ 30% - Stack -> Split -> Stack
				- @ 10% - Standard DPS Check
			- Alphamon is not a "real" boss. It dies almost immediately and is meant to be a transition phase for you to switch to DA Digimon.
			- Alphamon Ouryuken Awaken - Note-Worthy Mechanics:
				- @ 88%/17% - "Omae wa mo shinderu" (You are already dead)
					- 70k Damage to the whole party
				- @ 50% - Green Circle
					- AoA spawns 4 green circles on the ground. Stand inside one or get killed once the skill fully casts.
				- @ 30% - Stack -> Split -> Stack
				- @ 25% - Drops Poisons on 2 random players
				- @ 10% - Ordinemon DPS Check
					- AoA gets a 100% Attack buff. Kill before the tank dies.
